## About printf project from Cristian Betancur and Andr√©s Hurtado

Many programming languages implement a printf (print formatted) function, to display a formatted string. This, originally from the C programming language. The constant string format provides a description of the output, with placeholders marked by escape characters "%", to specify the relative location and type of output that the function should produce.
